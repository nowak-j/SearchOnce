# KreatywniInaczej-Project
Our first **web application**, aiming to build on the skills we gained during the **web development** course. 
<br>
As beginners, we created a simple page that lets you search multiple dictionaries at the same time. It allows the user to save time and displays results from *Merriam-Webster*, *Wiktionary*, and *Urban Dictionary* in one place.

It can be seen here: [https://nlp-ug-2021-22.github.io/KreatywniInaczej-Project/](https://nlp-ug-2021-22.github.io/KreatywniInaczej-Project/).
